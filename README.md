# Datastructs_Algs_1

A first of two labs completed for the intro to Datastructures & Algorithms course at KU Leuven. In this lab we analyze the complexity of different implementations of the A* algorithm to solve the generalization of the famous 8-puzzle problem. The findings, as well as explanations of certain software design choices, are written down in a concise [report](https://github.com/Ferrevdv/Datastructs_Algs_1/blob/main/report.pdf).
